<p ><b>Arbitration</b></p>
<p >Each User agrees that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between such User and PELMEL relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the Terms or your use of or access to the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that such User may assert claims in small claims court, if such User claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the provisions of the Terms as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, a User must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing the claim to our registered agent, LEGAL INC - 9 E Lookerman Street Suite 215, Dover, De 19901. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org"><span class="s1">www.adr.org</span></a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. A User may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where such User lives or at another mutually agreed location. Users agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, such User waive any right to a jury trial. User and PELMEL also both agree that either may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. If for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the City of Seattle, Washington. Subject to the arbitration provisions set forth above, the successful party in any dispute will be entitled to receive from the unsuccessful party all of its reasonable attorneys’ fees, cost, and disbursements. </p>
