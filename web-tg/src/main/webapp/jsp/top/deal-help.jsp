<p ><b>What is this?</b></p>
<p >This page indicates that this bar is offering a deal or discount to PELMEL users. Only the staff of the bar should press the deal button, otherwise the deal will be lost.</p>

<p ><b>I am the bartender, what should I do?</b></p>
<p>If you have not been briefed by anybody, press the "Report a problem" button and we will get back to you. This is the safest thing to do.</p>
<p>If you have been briefed, then you can safely tap the central animated button:
<ul>
<li>If it becomes <b>green</b>, then you can offer the deal as it means that our servers registered the use. You may want to perform your own verifications, barcode scanning for cross-comparing the transactions.</li>
<li>If it becomes <b>red</b>, then the user is not eligible for this deal. You should not offer anything to the user</li>
</ul>

<p><b>I am the user, what should I do?</b></p>
<p>If you reached this screen, it means everything looks good. You just have to present your phone to the bartender. He will do an action that will activate the deal and should offer you the deal.</p>
<p>Please note that between the time you access the screen and the time the bartender activates the deal, all deals may have been used and you may be rejected.</p>
