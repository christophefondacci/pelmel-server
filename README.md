# PELMEL Guide Server and Website

This repository is the entrypoint to everything server-related to PELMEL Guide :
* Everything related to http://www.pelmelguide.com website
* All services exposed by the server to the mobile apps
* Data model
* Performance
* Availability / monitoring
* Statistics / metrics

All components of the server are subfolders of this repository. Please use the bugtracker to report any problem with the server. In case you notice a bug on an app and you don't know if it is a server OR app issue, please report the bug where you located the problem (if seen on the app -> on the github app project, if seen on website -> on the github server project), and I will move the issue if needed.

Have fun!
The PELMEL Dev team ;)
